Image Classification

In this project we had to build and run a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow and use it to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project was written in Python (on a Jupyter Notebook) using the libraries numpy, pickle and tensorflow, running on an Anaconda environment.
